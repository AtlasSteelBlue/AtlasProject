<h2>About the Interactive Vector Map</h2>
<p>
This map shows basic interactions with a vector map.
</p>
<h3>Interaction</h3>
<p>
This map provides bi-directional interaction between the map and a table.
The map will also be centered at the selected table entry.
</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>
This map build on OpenLayers's vector capabilities. 
Additionally, the map includes the "RandomEtc Shapefile" library
in order to directly import shape and dbf files
(actually an improved version as it originally has some flaws).
</p>
<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>
Public data from the Swiss Statistical Office, Neuch√¢tel.
