<h2>About the Statistical Map</h2>
<p>
This map provides a container for statistical maps that use the same administrative boundaries.
</p>
<h3>Interaction</h3>
<p>
This map provides bi-directional interaction between the map and a table.
The map will also be centered at the selected table entry.
</p>
<h3>Categories</h3>
<p>
Uses an OpenLayers custom control to show the statistical categories.
</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>
This map builds on OpenLayers's vector capabilities. 
The map includes the "RandomEtc Shapefile" to import shape and dbf files
and the "px" and "Underscore" libraries to directly import PC-Axis database files (a sort of multi-dimensional database file).
Also included is a stripped-down version of Colorbrewer to get reasonable color scales.
</p>
<h3>To Do</h3>
<p>
Interactive categories. Timing of statistical updates.
</p>
<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>
Geometries and statistical data: public data from the Swiss Statistical Office, Neuch√¢tel.
