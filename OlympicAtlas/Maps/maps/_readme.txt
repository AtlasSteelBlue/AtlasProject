This is where all your map data and map files (HTML) go.
As an example, this directory contains:

- A 'mashups' directory: Contains a number of external maps that you can use as a base map for your own overlay maps
- A 'google-earth' directory: Contains map example with the Google Earth browser plug-in
- A 'wms' directory: Contains a few Web Map Service examples
- A 'mmkarto2012' directory: Contains a map example from a previous course
- A 'd3' directory: Contains a map example built with D3

Create a directory structure that is well suited for your needs.
When you are creating this structure please consider the following:

- Group the maps thematically, spatially or according to another criteria
- Put data that is needed for more than one map on a higher level
- Use short but meaningful directory names that most people can understand
- Do not use special characters in file and directory names since this might cause problems on different platforms

In your map script files consider the following:

- Use relative paths if you reference files within this atlas project
- Set the title (title tag)
- You might provide meta information (about meta tags see: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions)
