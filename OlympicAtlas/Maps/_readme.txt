This directory essentially contains 3 sub-directories:

- A 'maps' directory: This is where all your map data and map files (HTML) will be placed.
- A 'scripts' directory: This directory contains all scripts your map files need.
- A 'libraries' diriectory: Contains the libraries your Web maps need, typically in a compressed format.

Make sure that the maps do not depend on other data on a local machine (except data on a remote server).
This means that whenever you move this directory to another place or copy to a different machine,
you should be able to see the maps in the maps directory.
